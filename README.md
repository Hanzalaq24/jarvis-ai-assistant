## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- macOS/Linux/Windows
- Microphone access
- Internet connection

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hanzalaq24/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
cd jarvis-ai-assistant
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv jarvis_env
source jarvis_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: jarvis_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up API keys (Optional but recommended)**
```bash
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here" > .env   # Or export in your shell
# export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
```
Get your free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)

5. **Run JARVIS**
```bash
python app.py
```

6. **Open in browser**
Navigate to `http://localhost:8888`
   - The server binds to `127.0.0.1:8888` by default. If the port is busy, change the port in `app.py`.

### Alternative run
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8888
flask run
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Voice Commands
- **"Hey JARVIS, what time is it?"**
- **"Hey JARVIS, take a screenshot"**
- **"Hey JARVIS, recognize this song"** (while music is playing)
- **"Hey JARVIS, search for Python tutorials"**
- **"Hey JARVIS, open YouTube"**
- **"Hey JARVIS, the song goes: we are the champions"**

### Song Recognition
- **Background Music**: "recognize this song" - JARVIS listens to background audio
- **Singing/Humming**: "listen to me sing" - Record yourself singing
- **Lyrics Search**: "the song goes: shape of you" - Search by lyrics

### System Control
- **Screenshots**: "take a screenshot"
- **Photos**: "take a photo"
- **Volume**: "volume up", "mute volume"
- **Applications**: "open Chrome", "open Spotify"

### File commands (quick examples)
- Create file: "create file note.txt" or simply "create note" (creates note.txt on Desktop)
- Create folder: "create folder MyWork"
- Find: "find file report.pdf"
- Open from results: "open file 1"
- Delete: "delete file report.pdf" or "delete file report.pdf permanently"
- Restore: "restore file report.pdf"
- Rename: "rename file report.pdf to final_report.pdf"

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- **Flask Web Server**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Speech Recognition**: Real-time audio processing
- **AI Integration**: Groq API for intelligent responses
- **System Integration**: OS-level operations
- **Audio Processing**: Song recognition and analysis

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with animations
- **Voice Interface**: Web Speech API integration
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-like communication
- **Audio Visualization**: Recording indicators and feedback

### Key Components
- `app.py` - Main Flask application and command processing

2. **Singing/Humming Recognition**: Records and analyzes your voice
3. **Lyrics-based Search**: Matches song lyrics to database

### How It Works
1. **Audio Capture**: Uses Web Audio API for real-time audio processing

## üôè Acknowledgments

- Inspired by Tony Stark's JARVIS from Marvel
- Built with modern web technologies and AI
- Thanks to the open-source community for amazing libraries

## üêõ Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Microphone Access**: Ensure browser has microphone permissions
2. **TTS Not Working**: Some systems may have limited TTS support
3. **Song Recognition**: Requires clear audio for best results

### Performance Tips
- Use Chrome/Firefox for best compatibility
- Ensure stable internet connection for AI features
- Close other audio applications for better song recognition

### Port and binding
- Default bind is `127.0.0.1:8888`. If you can‚Äôt access it:
  - Ensure the server is running without errors: `python3 app.py`
  - Check for conflicts: `lsof -iTCP:8888 -sTCP:LISTEN`
  - Change port in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in `app.py`

### macOS permissions
- Allow microphone access in your browser for voice features
- If photo/screenshot fail, grant screen/camera permissions in System Settings
